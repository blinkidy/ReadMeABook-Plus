## What is this?

You run Plex or Audiobookshelf with audiobooks, and maybe BookOrbit for ebooks. You want more books. You search indexers, download torrents or NZBs, organize files, wait for your server to scan or ingest. ReadMeABook does all of that automatically.

Request an audiobook or EPUB → Prowlarr searches → qBittorrent or SABnzbd downloads → Files organized → Library imports or BookOrbit ingests. Done.

Also includes BookDate: AI recommendations with a Tinder-style swipe interface. Swipe right to request.

User friendly Audible-backed searches, multi-file chapter merging, first-class EPUB requests, optional e-book sidecar support, OIDC OAuth, admin approval workflows, and more.

## Features

- **Plex** or **Audiobookshelf**
- **Torrents** via qBittorrent
- **Usenet** via SABnzbd
- **Prowlarr** for indexer search (torrents + NZBs)
- **BookDate**: AI recommendations (OpenAI/Claude/Local) with swipe interface
- **Chapter merging**: Multi-file downloads → single M4B with chapters
- **EPUB requests**: First-class ebook requests with an independent BookOrbit ingest destination
- **E-book sidecar**: Optional companion EPUB/PDF downloads
- **Request approval**: Admin approval workflow for multi-user setups
- **Setup wizard**: Step-by-step guided config with connection testing

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** Docker, Plex or Audiobookshelf, qBittorrent or SABnzbd, Prowlarr

### Quick Start

```bash
# Download docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kikootwo/readmeabook/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml

# Start the container
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3030 and follow the setup wizard.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to customize the compose file:

```yaml
services:
  readmeabook:
    image: ghcr.io/kikootwo/readmeabook:latest
    container_name: readmeabook
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3030:3030"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./cache:/app/cache
      - ./downloads:/downloads        # Your download client's path
      - ./media:/media                # Your audiobook library
      - ./bookorbit-ingest:/bookorbit/ingest  # Your BookOrbit ingest folder
      - ./bookorbit-library:/bookorbit/library:ro  # Your finished BookOrbit library
      - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./redis:/var/lib/redis
    environment:
      PUID: 1000                      # Optional: your user ID
      PGID: 1000                      # Optional: your group ID
      BOOKORBIT_INGEST_PATH: "/bookorbit/ingest"  # EPUB destination
      BOOKORBIT_LIBRARY_PATH: "/bookorbit/library"  # Availability scan source
      PUBLIC_URL: "https://audiobooks.example.com"  # Required for OAuth
```

Then run `docker compose up -d` to start.

**Important:** Your download client (qBittorrent/SABnzbd) and RMAB must see files at the same path. See the [Volume Mapping Guide](documentation/deployment/volume-mapping.md) if downloads aren't being detected.

EPUB requests use `BOOKORBIT_INGEST_PATH` or the EPUB Destination Path in Settings. BookOrbit availability scanning uses `BOOKORBIT_LIBRARY_PATH` for the finished library; leave it unset only if files remain in the ingest folder.

## Built with AI Assistance

This is a human-engineered application. Architecture, design decisions, code review, and project direction are managed by a principal engineer with nearly 15 years of professional software development experience.

AI tools (Claude, GitHub Copilot) serve as force multipliers. Accelerating implementation, maintaining consistency, and handling boilerplate, while human expertise drives the technical vision. This mirrors how AI assistance is used at leading technology companies today.

**The workflow:**
- Token-optimized documentation system designed for AI consumption ([CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md))
- Structured navigation enabling AI to find relevant context without reading entire codebases
- Consistent architectural patterns that AI tools can follow and extend
- Human review of all AI-generated code before merge

The result: enterprise-grade velocity on a solo project without sacrificing code quality or architectural integrity.
